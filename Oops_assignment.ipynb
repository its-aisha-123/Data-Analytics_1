        "Encapsulation: This is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It helps protect the internal state of an object from unintended interference and misuse by providing a controlled interface for interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. This helps in reducing complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: This is a mechanism that allows one class (the child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (the parent or superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, and can be achieved through method overriding and overloading."
